# Accessibility

## General 💻
Web accessibility is the practice of making web content accessible to all people, including those with disabilities. It involves designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

To make a website accessible, we use several key tools:

1. **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: These are special CSS rules that detect screen size and adjust the layout accordingly. For example, a website might show a single column on phones but three columns on desktop screens.

2. **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**:
   - WCAG conformance levels (A, AA, and AAA)

3. **Tools**:
   - WAVE
   - aXe
   - Screen readers
