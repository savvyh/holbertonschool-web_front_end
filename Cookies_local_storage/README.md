### 5.

**Reusing the code from the previous task:**

*   Build the Welcome message with Javascript without using HTML
*   Use `js-cookie` for every cookie manipulation

  

### 6.

**Let’s build a basic shopping cart in a new file. Setup your files with the following:**

*   Create an array `availableItems` that will contain all the available items. Add the strings `Shampoo`, `Soap`, `Sponge`, and `Water` in the array
*   If Local storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message `Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one`
*   If local storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function `createStore` and `displayCart`

**Create a function `addItemToCart`:**

*   It takes on argument `item` (string)
*   It adds a key to the local storage of the name of the item, and set the value to `true`

**Create a function `createStore`:**

*   Create a `ul` and append it to the DOM
*   Loop through the array of items, and create a list item to add to the `ul`
*   The item should display the name of the available product
*   On click the item should call the function `addItemToCart`

**Create a function `displayCart`:**

*   If the local storage does not contain any item, this function does not do anything
*   If the local storage contains any item, it should display the message `You previously had X items in your cart` in a `p` element that you can append to the body

**Tips:**

*   At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items
*   If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message `You previously had 2 items in your cart`
*   If you open a new tab, you should also see the message `You previously had 2 items in your cart`

**Requirements:**

*   Build the DOM using Javascript only
*   You must use the local storage of your browser and not a cookie or session storage
*   Access your code with `http://localhost:8080/5-index.html`
*   Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

  

### 7.

Reusing the code from the previous task, replace the use of local storage by session storage

**Tips:**

*   At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items
*   If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message `You previously had 2 items in your cart`
*   If you open a new tab, you should not see any message

**Requirements:**

*   Build the DOM using Javascript only
*   You must use the session storage of your browser and not a cookie or local storage
*   Access your code with `http://localhost:8080/6-index.html`
*   Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

  

### 8.

**In a new file, let’s build a more advanced cart system using Session Storage. Setup your files with the following:**

*   Create an array `availableItems` that will contain all the available items. Add the strings `Shampoo`, `Soap`, `Sponge`, and `Water` to the array
*   If session storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message `Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one`
*   If session storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function `createStore` and `displayCart`

**Create a function `getCartFromStorage`:**

*   It should parse a string into a JSON object, returning the content of the cart stored in Session storage
*   If there is no cart, it should return an empty object

**Create a function `addItemToCart`:**

*   It accepts `item`(string) as argument
*   It adds to the cart object the item
*   If the same item is added multiple times, the cart store the quantity
*   It stores the value of the cart object in a string for the key `cart` in the Session Storage
*   It calls `displayCart`

**Create a function `removeItemfromCart`:**

*   It accepts `item`(string) as argument
*   It remove the entire item from the cart
*   Store the value of the cart object in a string for the key `cart` in the Session Storage
*   It calls `displayCart`

**Create a function `clearCart`:**

*   It should clear the entire Session storage
*   it calls `displayCart`

**Create a function `createStore`:**

*   It should add a `h2` tag with the text `Available products:`
*   It should add a list with every item available for purchase
*   When the user click on an item, it should add it to the cart

**Create a function `displayCart`:**

*   It should add inside a `h2` tag with the text `Your cart:`
*   It should add an empty `div` tag
*   If the `div` tag already exist, it should remove any list child
*   It calls updateCart

**Create a function `updateCart`:**

*   It should add a list to the `div` tag created previously
*   If the cart is empty, it should add an item `Your cart is empty`
*   If the cart is not empty, it should add the list of items within the cart with the following format: `ITEM_NAME x QUANTITY (remove)`
*   When the user clicks on remove, it should call the function `removeItemfromCart`
*   At the top of the cart, add an item named `Clear my cart`. When the user clicks on it, it should call the function `clearCart`

**Tips:**

*   You can look at the GIF below to see how the interaction with the different elements works
