## Tasks üìù

0. Setup your dev environment : In a file [0-index.html](./0-index.html):

- Load the latest version of jQuery using their `code.jquery.com` CDN
- Use the Slim & minified version of jQuery
- When the page is being loaded, verify that jQuery is loaded correctly
- If jQuery is ready to be used, log to the console `jQuery has been loaded correctly`
- If jQuery has not been loaded properly, log to the console `jQuery has not been loaded `correctly<br>

1. Creating a DOM element : In a file [1-index.html](./1-index.html):

- Remove the code that verifies jQuery loaded and logs messages to the console
- Create a function named `createTextElement`: Within the function, create a `p` HTML element
- The paragraph should display `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed in diam risus. Nunc sit amet euismod ipsum. Aenean tempus ex sed est volutpat, sed sodales velit tempus. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Proin auctor sollicitudin eleifend. Vivamus porta enim vitae mauris commodo, vitae tempor tellus elementum. Quisque sed pellentesque nulla, at eleifend nisi. Phasellus eget tincidunt ex. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.`
- Add the paragraph to the `body` of the page
- Call the `createTextElement` function<br>

2. Creating multiple DOM elements at once : In a file [2-index.html](./2-index.html):

- Remove the function `createTextElement`

- The first cell displays the `firstName`, the second cell displays the `lastName`
- The third cell displays `(x)`
- On click on the third cell, it should remove the row
- Add CSS to the third cell to have an orange background
- Calls the function `createFamilyTree`
- Using `addNewMember`, generate a fake table
- You must use the keywords `click`, `css`, and `remove`<br>

6. Val, before, and prepend functions : In a file [6-index.html](./6-index.html):

- Reuse the template you created previously.
- Reuse the function `createFamilyTree` you wrote in the previous task
- Reuse the function `addNewMember` you wrote in the previous task, and add the following modification:
- The function should accept a new argument `position`(string)
- When `position` is equal to `before`, it should add the row at the top of the table
- Otherwise, it should add the row at the bottom of the table

- Import jQuery using the CDN and make sure you can access the ajax methods
- Create a form:
- Create a function `createSearchForm`, it should append to the `body`:
- An empty input of type text without `ID`, `name`, or `class`
- An `input` of type `submit`
- When the user clicks on the submit button, it should query the function `queryWikipedia` that you are going to create with the value of the text `input`
- An empty `ul` element
- Create a function `addNewArticle` to add new items to a list
- It accepts three arguments `id`(string), `title`(string), and `snippet`(string)

- For each result returned by the API, call the function `addNewArticle` with the result‚Äôs `pageid`, `title`, and `snippet`
- Call the function `createSearchForm` when the page loads
- Look at the documentation from Wikipedia to query the API https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search

- Create a new function named `buildPagination`:
- It accepts three arguments `numberOfItems`(number), `itemsPerPage`(number), and `currentOffset`(number)
- When the function is called, reset the pagination list to an empty tag
- Write a loop that will display the pagination (using the total number of items `div`ided by the number of items per page)
- For each page, create a list item
- Add some CSS for each item (`cursor: 'pointer'`, `10px margin left`, and `bold` when this is the current page)
- The text of the item should be the page number
- When clicking on a page number, it should call the function `queryWikipedia` with the right offset
- Use the `totalhits` value from Wikipedia to define the total number of items
- Display `10` items per page
- Make sure your pages are displayed in an horizontal line<br>

9. Wrap / Unwrap : In a file [9-index.html](./9-index.html):

- Reuse the code from the previous task
- In the header, add some CSS, with the style tag:

- Set the opacity at `0.2` within that class
- In your script with your other functions, create a function named `displayLoading`:
- It accepts one argument `loading`
- It select the first `ul` element of the page
- If `loading` is true, it wraps the element with a `div` tag and the class `loading`
- If `loading` is false, it unwrap the `ul` from the `div`
