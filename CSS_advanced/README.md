# Web Front-End : CSS

## General üíª
In this project, I just use CSS to styling the website.


By the end of this project, I'll be able to explain key CSS concepts:

CSS encompasses selectors, properties, and values, serving as the foundation for styling web elements. Selectors target HTML elements, properties define their appearance, and values specify parameters for each property. Block styling applies to elements occupying full width, while inline styling suits those needing minimal space. Consistency across browsers is ensured through CSS resets, removing default styles. CSS variables enhance maintainability by storing reusable values. Styles can be applied inline, embedded within HTML, or linked externally. Grid systems organize layout with rows and columns, often utilizing floats. Icon webfonts and SVG icons provide scalable graphics options. Pseudo-classes target element states, while pseudo-elements modify specific parts. Background gradients create smooth color transitions, and CSS animations add interactive motion. Transformations modify element position, rotation, size, and perspective. Vendor prefixes ensure compatibility by adapting to browser standards and experimental features.
