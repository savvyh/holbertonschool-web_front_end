## General 💻
In this project, I just use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling - don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly” it’s normal, it’s not the purpose of this project.

At the end of this project, I will be able to explain key HTML guidelines and demonstrate the proper creation of an HTML5 page structure. I'll utilize semantic HTML tags effectively to organize content, understanding the nuances between <div> and <span> for different use cases. I'll grasp the semantic significance of <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <nav>, <section>, and <aside> tags for structuring web pages. Learning the hierarchical order of headings will be important for creating well-organized content. I'll also master the creation of lists and understand the differences between media formats such as SVG, GIF, PNG, and JPG. Structuring data within tables and integrating multimedia content like videos and audio files, as well as embedding external content, will become second nature. Throughout, I'll ensure proper HTML page structure is maintained.
