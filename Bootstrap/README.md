## General ðŸ’»

#### Usage of Containers
Bootstrap containers are the most basic layout element and are required when using the default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.

There are 3 main types of containers:
- `.container` - provides a responsive fixed width container
- `.container-fluid` - provides a full width container that spans the entire viewport
- `.container-{breakpoint}` - responsive containers that become 100% wide until the specified breakpoint

#### Usage of the Grid system
- The grid system in Bootstrap is used to create responsive layouts.
- The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, which means that you can create layouts with up to 12 columns.
- The grid system is responsive, which means that it will adjust to the size of the screen.
- The grid system is based on flexbox, which means that it will adjust to the size of the screen.

#### Usage of Components
Bootstrap components are pre-styled HTML elements that can be reused throughout your project. They are designed to work seamlessly with the grid system and can be easily customized.

#### Usage of Utilities
Bootstrap utilities are small, reusable CSS classes that can be applied to HTML elements to modify their appearance or behavior. They are designed to be used in conjunction with the grid system and components.
