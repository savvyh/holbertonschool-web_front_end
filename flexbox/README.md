## Description :dart:
To master CSS Flexbox, you need to understand how it works as a flexible and adaptive layout model, allowing you to organize elements in rows or columns. It is important to know how to replace old techniques based on float with Flexbox, align elements easily both horizontally and vertically using properties like justify-content and align-items, and understand the difference between the main axis (defined by flex-direction) and the cross axis. You will also learn to distinguish the properties specific to the flex container (like flex-wrap or align-items) from those for individual flex items (like order or align-self), use shortcuts like flex to simplify your code, and design modern and responsive web pages by integrating Flexbox from the start of the design process.

## Start : ðŸ’»
