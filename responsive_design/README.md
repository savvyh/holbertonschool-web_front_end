# Responsive Design

## General 💻
Responsive web design is an approach that makes websites look good on all devices. It starts with mobile-first design, where we begin by designing for small screens first. This makes sense because most people now use their phones to browse the internet.

To make a website responsive, we use several key tools:

1. **Media Queries**: These are special CSS rules that detect screen size and adjust the layout accordingly. For example, a website might show a single column on phones but three columns on desktop screens.

2. **Standard Screen Sizes**:
   - Phone screens: 320px - 480px
   - Tablets: 481px - 768px
   - Computer screens: 769px and larger

3. **Flexible Elements**: We use special units to make elements adjust automatically:
   - % (percentage): sizes based on parent element
   - em/rem: sizes based on text size
   - vh/vw: sizes based on screen size

The main difference between responsive and adaptive design is how they handle different screens:
- Responsive design flows smoothly between sizes
- Adaptive design changes suddenly at specific points
